## üîß App Workflow Explained

### 1. **Home Screen**
- `Set()` variables to reset all system factor flags to `false`.
- Clears old response collections.
- Prepares user session for new decision flow.

```powerfx
Set(varCurrentUserEmail, User().Email);
Set(varWillemployeemakebetterchoices, false);
Set(varAretheresystemperformanceshapingfactors, false);
Clear(colResponse);
Set(varContainerStep1, false);
```

### 2. **Start Button**
- Prepares navigation to the first decision step.

```powerfx
Set(vargalleryStep1, true);
Set(vargalleryStep2, false);
Set(vargalleryStep3, false);
Navigate('Just Culture Decision Support Tool');
```

### 3. **Behavior Selection (Step 1 Buttons)**
- Depending on the selected behavior, it patches Step 1 info into `JustCultureDecisionToolResults`.
- Saves Behavior classification.
- Moves to Step 2 (system checks).

```powerfx
If(
    ThisItem.ID = 1 || ThisItem.ID = 23 || ThisItem.ID = 26 || ThisItem.ID = 25 || ThisItem.ID = 24,
    Set(varContainerStep1,true);
    Set(VarStep3bt,false),

    Patch(JustCultureDecisionToolResults,
    {
        ELT: ELTdd.Selected.Value,
        Service: Servicedd.SelectedText.Value,
        Step1: ThisItem.Step1,
        Behavior: If(
            ThisItem.ID = 25, "AT RISK Behavior",
            If(ThisItem.ID = 24,"Human Error",
            If(ThisItem.ID = 26,"RECKLESS Behavior",
            If(ThisItem.ID = 1,"IMPAIRED JUDGEMENT"))))
    });

    Refresh(JustCultureDecisionToolResults);
    Set(varID, Last(JustCultureDecisionToolResults).ID);
    Set(varContainerStep1,true);
    Set(vargalleryStep1, false);
    Set(vargalleryStep3, false)
)
```

### 4. **Substitution Test (Step 2 Yes Button)**
- Records Step 2 response.
- Advances to Step 3.

```powerfx
Patch(
    JustCultureDecisionToolResults,
    {
        ELT: ELTdd.Selected.Value,
        Service: Servicedd.SelectedText.Value,
        Step1: Step1bt.Text,
        Step2:  Button6.Text,
        Behavior: Behaviortxt_1.Text 
    }
);
Refresh(JustCultureDecisionToolResults);
Set(varID, Last(JustCultureDecisionToolResults).ID);
Set(vargalleryStep1, false);
Set(vargalleryStep3, true);
Set(varContainerStep1,false);
```

### 5. **Repetitive Behavior (Step 3 Yes Button)**
- Updates Step 3 response.
- Navigates based on Step 3 outcome.

```powerfx
Patch(
    JustCultureDecisionToolResults,
    LookUp(JustCultureDecisionToolResults, ThisRecord.ID = varID),
    {Step3: ThisItem.Step3}
);

Set(
    varTargetScreen,
    If(
        Step3bt.Text = "Yes",
        'Repetitive Occurrences of: Human Error / At Risk Behavior / Reckless Behavior',
        SuccessSc_1
    )
);
Navigate(varTargetScreen);
```

### 6. **Final Save and PDF Generation**
- At the end, final choices are updated.
- PDF is generated summarizing the session.

```powerfx
Patch(
    JustCultureDecisionToolResults,
    LookUp(JustCultureDecisionToolResults, ThisRecord.ID = varID),
    {
        'Are there behavior choices that are causing the repetitive occurrences?': "No",
        'Consider System Re-design.': "Yes",
        'Are there system performance shaping factors?': "Yes",
        'Did this tool help you in Just Culture decision making?': "Yes"
    }
);

Set(varWorkOrderPDF, PDF('Repetitive Occurrences of: Human Error / At Risk Behavior / Reckless Behavior', {ExpandContainers: true}));
DownloadPDFFromPowerApps.Run(varID, {
    file: {
        name: $"Results_{Text(Now(), "yyyymmddhhmmss")}.pdf",
        contentBytes: varWorkOrderPDF
    }
});
Navigate(Home);
```
