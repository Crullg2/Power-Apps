## üöÄ How It Works

- **Gallery-based Layout**: Days of the month are rendered through a slider-controlled gallery.
- **Date Calculation**: Clicking a day cell calculates the correct date, even across months.
- **Holiday Highlighting**: Holidays automatically adjust if they fall on weekends.
- **Theme and Styling**: Colors and fonts are controlled through the `Theme` object.
- **Live App Detection**: Adjusts gallery template height automatically when running in the published app vs. the IDE.
- **Progress Bar** *(Optional)*: Progress bar added for additional polish.

## üõ† Known Updates/Fixes

- **Holiday Correction**: Fixed Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve weekday observance issue.
- **HTMLText Issue**: Adjusted the gallery sizing dynamically to fix the rendering glitch between editor mode and live app mode.
- **Progress Bar**: Added optional progress bar feature (can be hidden if not needed).
- **Early Work on Rich Text Editor**: Future expansion planned (ignore for now).
